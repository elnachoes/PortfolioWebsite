      <h2 id="shortDescription">Basic Echo Server is a multi-threaded socket server written in C# and Dotnet 6 that echoes messages sent from clients connecting over telnet.</h2>
      <a class="SourceLink" href="https://github.com/elnachoes/BasicEchoServer">Source Code</a>
      <b id="longDescription">
        <ul>
          <li>The project started as a learning experience to learn how to communicate over tcp sockets and how to write multi-threaded code that can be useful during synchronous blocking calls such as synchronous receives over sockets.</li>
          <li>Early in development, the project started with a server application that communicated over sockets asynchronously by using a thread to accept new clients and for each client that connected, a thread was created to synchronously receive data from that socket.</li>
          <li>Later on in development, a connection object was created as a means of encapsulating communication between sockets. The connection object could handle the shut down of a socket, synchronous sends, synchronous receives, and even asynchronous receives. Asynchronous receives and socket shutdowns also invoked call back functions.</li>
          <li>The project moved from a thread-per-client model on the server to a asynchronous receive model on the connection object to alleviate cpu overhead from context switching between threads and so the client applications could also do asynchronous receive.</li>
