                My name is Corbin Martin and I am a Computer Science student at Clark College in Vancouver WA.
                I am passionate about learning to write software in all forms including embedded systems, backend, front end, web, video games ect.
                This is an aggregation of the projects I have worked on so far including the links to their source code.
