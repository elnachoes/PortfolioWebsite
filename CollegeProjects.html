                <li>The project started as an assignment for a data structures class in order to study how hash tables work.</li>
                <li>The project uses a fixed size hash table and utilizes chaining as a means of collision management rather than something more complex such as probing. If the hash table encounters a collision with its hashing algorithm it creates a sentinel node to a linked list at each index of the hash table and if a collision occurs it will append the hash name and data to the linked list stored at that hash index.</li>
                <li>The hash table does not undergo load management and because it is a fixed size, performance and efficiency can degrade with the growing size of the data stored in the hash table.</li>
                <li>The project has been a very good learning experience to gain more insight into how hash tables are constructed.</li>
