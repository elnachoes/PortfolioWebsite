                <li>The project started as a learning experience to learn how to communicate over tcp sockets and how to write multithreaded code that can be useful during synchronous blocking calls such as synchronous receives over sock</li>
                <li>Early in development, the project started with a server application that communicated over sockets asynchronously by using a thread to accept new clients and for each client that connected, a thread was created to synchronously receive data from that soc</li>
                <li>Later on in development, a connection object was created as a means of encapsulating communication between sockets. The connection object could handle the shut down of a socket, synchronous sends, synchronous receives, and even asynchronous receives. Asynchronous receives and socket shutdowns also invoked call back functi</li>
                <li>The project moved from a thread-per-client model on the server to a asynchronous receive model on the connection object to alleviate cpu overhead from context switching between threads and so the client applications could also do asynchronous recei</li>

                <li>This is a sequel project to a single threaded prime numbers calculator written in C where the Sieve of Eratosthenes and other optimizations were used in order to significantly decrease the number of calculations needed in order to check if a number is prime. On a ryzen 5 3600 cpu machine, the 5 millionth prime on the original single threaded Fast Primes project could be found in about 196 seco</li>
                <li>Fast Primes 2 takes advantage of a parallel foreach from the Parallel library to multithread testing of potentially prime numb</li>
                <li>The parallel foreach divides out potentially prime numbers and if they are prime they are added to a list inside of a mutex for thread safety that will be sorted by a LINQ statement and counted later on to determine the current prime posit</li>
                <li>The application can be given 2 command line arguments for the Nth prime you wish to find and how many potentially prime numbers do you wish to test at a given iteration of the parallel foreach l</li>
                <li>The project turned out to be very successful with the 5 millionth prime being calculated on a ryzen 5 3600 cpu machine with 10k potential primes to test per iteration of the parallel foreach loop in just under 33 seco</li>
                <li>The application performed even better with a ryzen 9 5900x cpu machine under the same conditions finding the 5 millionth prime in just over 5 seco</li>

                <li>The idea of composition vs inheritance is very central to the learning experience of this project where it may be important to consider what items are specific enough to be a component vs what items can be inherited from some base cl</li>
                <li>In the project multiple objects inherit from a base class such as the turret and the tank but they override methods in the base class in their own unique ways depending on what their purposes </li>
