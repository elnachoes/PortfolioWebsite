                        <li>The Knapsack problem is about how many items can you put in a bag with a weight capacity and maximize the value of what is put into the bag by using a recursive algorithm.</li>
                        <li>In order to stop the algorithm from repeatedly solving the same problems again and again it makes use of a cache that stores previous return values based on it's arguments.</li>

                        <li>The project started as an assignment for a data structures class in order to study how hash tables work.</li>
                        <li>The project uses a fixed size hash table and utilizes chaining as a means of collision management rather than something more complex such as probing. If the hash table encounters a collision with its hashing algorithm it creates a sentinel node to a linked list at each index of the hash table and if a collision occurs it will append the hash name and data to the linked list stored at that hash index.</li>
                        <li>The hash table does not undergo load management and because it is a fixed size, performance and efficiency can degrade with the growing size of the data stored in the hash table.</li>
                        <li>The project has been a very good learning experience to gain more insight into how hash tables are constructed.</li>
